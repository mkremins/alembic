	Serves the specified request, taking the following steps to identify
	currently enabled plugins capable of handling the request and delegate the
	handling of the request to these plugins:

	1. Associates each plugin with a _priority value_ for the request by
	   invoking the `Alembic.Plugin.Behaviour.screen/2` plugin callback on each
	   plugin, passing the request and client as arguments and making note of
	   the priority value each plugin returns.

	2. Sorts the list of currently enabled plugins by priority and discards
	   those plugins that declared a priority of `:ignore` (indicating an
	   intention to ignore the request), producing an appropriately ordered
	   list of plugins that should each be given an opportunity to handle the
	   request.

	3. Takes plugins from the list â€“ in order of priority â€“ and invokes the
	   `Alembic.Plugin.Behaviour.handle/2` plugin callback on each plugin,
	   passing the request and client as arguments. Stops either when every
	   plugin in the list has been given a chance to handle the request, or
	   when one of the plugins consumes the request by returning `:consume`
	   from the `handle` callback.

	Any currently enabled plugin that errors out during this process (by
	returning `{:error, reason}` from either callback, or by throwing an
	exception of any sort) should be disabled.
