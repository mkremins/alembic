Alembic
========================================

Alembic is the successor to my [Nodecraft](http://github.com/mkremins/nodecraft.git) project: a bare-bones, concurrent and heavily extensible server for multiplayer voxel games that speaks the Minecraft protocol. It's _also_ an excuse for me to experiment with the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) programming language and the coroutine-esque concurrency model favored by the BEAM (Erlang) VM atop which Elixir resides.

What is it?
----------------------------------------

### A foundation to build on

I'm attempting to keep Alembic's core as lightweight as possible. Doing so forces me to implement much of the desired functionality in plugins that are bundled with the standard Alembic distribution, which comes with a number of benefits:

* I'll have to develop a robust, reusable plugin API that supports both high-level (abstractions representing core gameplay mechanics) and low-level (packet manipulation) functionality.
* If you want to use Alembic as a platform for an entirely different voxel game, you can start by just ripping out most of the stuff in the `plugins` directory. (The core will still run afterwards.)
* If you want to develop plugins, you'll have a bunch of good examples right in front of you.

### A good place to start

Since I'm new to this whole Elixir thing and there aren't a lot of Elixir apps out there yet from whose good examples I can learn, I'd like for Alembic to become such an example: a well-architected, idiomatic Elixir app, accessible to those who are just starting out with the language. As such, it's important to me that every chunk of code that makes it into the Alembic core is as well-documented and readable as possible.

### A generic and practical voxel game engine

While I'm targeting the Minecraft protocol (or, at least, a strict subset of said protocol) at first, there's no reason why Alembic should be limited to the role of "another Minecraft server". In fact, there's a load of problems with the way the Minecraft client handles things, and I'd rather not tether my API to the limitations of a particular existing game.

Ideally, somewhere down the line, anything you can do with a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) server you'll be able to do with Alembic â€“ but, and this is the key part, you'll also be able to do things that Bukkit (being way too Minecraft-specific for my liking) _doesn't_ allow.
